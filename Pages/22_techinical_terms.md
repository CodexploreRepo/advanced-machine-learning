# A
- **Anomaly Detection**: (also called outlier detection) is the task of detecting instances that deviate strongly from the norm. These instances are called *anomalies*, or *outliers*, while the normal instances are called *inliers*.

- **Novelty Detection**: is the task of classifying test data that differ in some respect from the data that are available during training. This may be seen as “one-class classification”, in which a model is
constructed to describe “normal” training data. The novelty detection approach is typically used when the quantity of available “abnormal” data is insufficient to construct explicit models for non-normal classes.it differs from anomaly detection in that the algorithm is assumed to be trained on a “clean” dataset, uncontaminated by outliers, whereas anomaly detection does not make this assumption. Indeed, outlier detection is often used to clean up a dataset.
