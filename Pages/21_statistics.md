# 1. Probability vs Likelihood
- The terms “probability” and “likelihood” are often used interchangeably in the English language, but they have very different meanings in statistics.
- Given a statistical model with some parameters θ,
  - **Probability** is used to describe how plausible a future outcome x is (knowing the parameter values θ)
  - **Likelihood** is used to describe how plausible a particular set of parameter values θ are, after the outcome x is known.
