# 1. Introduction
## 1.1. Why study Machine Learning
- Automating automation
- Getting computers to program themselves
- Writing software is the bottleneck
- Let the data do the work instead!

## 1.2. Niches for Machine Learning
- **Data Mining**: use historical data to improve decisions
  - e.g. Medical records &#8594; medical knowledge
- **Software Applications** that are hard to program by hand: Speech recognition, Image classification, Autonomous driving
- **User Modeling**: Automatic Recommender Systems
